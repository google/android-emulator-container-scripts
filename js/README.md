JavaScript WebRTC samples
=========================

This document descibes how to run the gRPC/WebRTC example. Support for WebRTC is officially only available on linux releases.
This sample expects the emulator to be running in a server like environment:

- There is a Webserver hosting the HTML/JS
- There is a [gRPC web proxy](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/)
- The udp ports required for WebRTC are open, or a turn service is configured.

These services should be accessible for the browsers that want to interact with the emulator. For example a publicly visible GCE/AWS server should work fine.

This sample is based on ReactJS and provides the following set of components:

- Emulator: This component displays the emulator and will send mouse & keyboard events to it.
- LogcatView: A view that displays the current output of logcat. This currently relies on the material-ui theme.

Both components require the following properties to be set:

- `emulator`: This property must contain an `EmulatorControllerService` object.

Components that you will need to include:

- EmulatorWebrtcView: A view on the emulator that is using WebRTC. It will use the Jsep protocol over gRPC to establish the video streams. This is the preferred method to view the emulator, as it will provide the best experience.
- EmulatorPngView:  A view on the emulator that is generated by requesting a screenshot at a fixed interval. Beware that these screenshots can arrive out of order, so the user experience could be a little odd at times. *Note: This is very expensive, and is merely here to showcase how you could make an interactive UI using gRPC.*
- EmulatorFallbackView: A View that will use WebRTC if possible, and otherwise will revert to using the png view.
- JsepProtocol: An invisible component that takes care of the JSepProtocol.
- EmulatorControllerService: A component that takes care of the gRPC interactions and will inject authentication headers when needed.
- TokenAuthService: An authentication service that provides a JWT token to the EmulatorControllerService.

You will likely need to modify `App.js` and `index.html` to suit your needs.

# Dependencies

The JavaScript sample has the following requirements:

- You are using linux.
- You have android sdk installed, and the environment variable `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` is set properly. The easiest way to install the sdk is by installing [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).
- An emulator build newer than 5769853. You can either:
  - Check if your current installed version will work. Run:
   ```sh
    $ $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator -version | head -n 1
    ```
    and make sure that the reported build_id is higher than 5769853
  - Build one from source yourself.
  - Obtain one from the [build bots](http://go/ab/emu-master-dev). Make sure to get sdk-repo-linux-emulator-XXXX.zip where XXXX is the build number. You can unzip the contents to `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`. For example:
  ```sh
    $ unzip ~/Downloads/sdk-repo-linux-emulator-5775474.zip -d $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT
  ```
- A valid virtual device to run inside the emulator. Instructions on how to create a virtual device can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds). Any virtual device can be used.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) Stable version 10.16.1 LTS or later.
- A [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) compiler, version 3.6 or higher is supported.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com). We will use the container infrastructure for easy deployment. Follow the instructions [here](http://go/installdocker) if you are within Google.


# Configure the emulator

Make sure you are able to launch the emulator from the command line with a valid avd. Instructions on how to create a virtual device can be found [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds).

For example if you created a avd with the name P, you should be able to launch it as follows:

```sh
  $ $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator @P
```

Make sure that the emulator is working properly, and that can use the desired avd.

WebRTC support will be activated if the emulator is launched with the `-grpc <port>` flag. The current demos expect the gRPC endpoint to be available at `localhost:8554`. This port only needs to be accessible by the gRPC proxy that is being used. There is no need for this port to be publicly visible.

```sh
  $ $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/emulator/emulator @P -grpc 8554
```

### Do I need TURN?

The most important thing to is to figure out if you need a [Turn Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT). **You usually only need this if your server running the emulator is behind a firewall, and not publicly accessible.** Most of the time there is no need for a turn server.

If for example you are running the emulator in a private Google GCE project, you will need to make use of a turn server. You can take the following steps to enable turn:

1. Enable a turn service. There are many services you could use. A quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=webrtc+turn+server+cloud+providers) will provide a series of provides. If you are internal at google you could use the [GCE turn api](http://go/turnaas).
2. Launch the emulator with the `-turncfg` flag.
   This will inform the videobridge to execute the given command for every new incoming connection to obtain the JSON turn configuration that will be used.

    This command must do the following:

    - Produce a result on stdout.
    - Produce a result within 1000 ms.
    - Produce a valid [JSON RTCConfiguration object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCConfiguration).
    - That contain at least an "iceServers" array.
    - The exit value should be 0 on success

    For example:

    ```sh
    emulator -grpc 8554 -turncfg "curl -s -X POST https://networktraversal.googleapis.com/v1alpha/iceconfig?key=MySec"
    ```

# Configuring the web server

Once you can run the emulator with your avd of choice it is time to install all the development dependencies.

```sh
 $ make deps
```

If all goes well all the go, protobuf and javascript dependencies will be installed.

## As a Developer

As a developer you will make use of an envoy docker container and use node.js to serve the react app.  You can launch the develop environment with:

```sh
  $ make develop
```

This should open up a browser, and detect any change made to the webpages and JavaScript sources. Hit ctrl-c to stop the dev environmnent.


## Limitations

gRPC is not well supported in the browser and has only support for unary calls and server side streaming. This restricts support for other services
such as [Waterfall](https://github.com/google/devx-tools/tree/master/waterfall).
